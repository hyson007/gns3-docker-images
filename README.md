# GNS3 Docker Images

This is my playground for creating docker images,
that work with GNS3 V1.5, see https://github.com/GNS3

The images are available from Docker Hub <https://hub.docker.com/u/ehlers/>.

After building the images locally, they can be pushed to DockerHub.
Only modified images are pushed. Login with `docker login` before.

```
docker login
./hub_push
```
