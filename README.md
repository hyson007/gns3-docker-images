# GNS3 Docker Images

This is my playground for creating docker images,
that work with GNS3 V1.5, see https://github.com/GNS3

The images are available from Docker Hub https://hub.docker.com/u/ehlers/
If you don't want to trigger the builds by a GitHub push,
you can use the script `hub_build` to trigger the build.
